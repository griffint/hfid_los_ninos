        <h3>Prototype testing instructions</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Our prototype is a functioning html site with a not fully functional backend. That is, you can test most interactions but your data will not be 
        persistently saved. Below we've laid out some tasks for you to try that our personas would have to do in their daily usage of our site. 
        </p>
        <h5>Task 1</h5>
        <p>Create an account by registering with the site, and fill out your profile with some basic and advanced information.</p>
        <h5>Task 2</h5>
        <p>Go to the map view and look through the people and places that are available. Use filters to narrow your search, and add someone to your bookmarks.</p>
        <h5>Task 3</h5>
        <p>Go check out your bookmaks, look at more info to find out more about them.</p>
        <h5>Task 4</h5>
        <p>Look at your pending group requests, and accept or reject whatever one seems better</p>
    	<br>
    	<h5>Wireframes</h5>
    	<p>Here we'll put some information about our wireframes</p>
