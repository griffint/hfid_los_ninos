Newegg Search Narrowing lists all of the features of the device in question and lets the user select criteria ranges for each of these features as filters, allowing users to hone in on product traits that are important to them. These narrowing filters remove products that do not fit the user’s specifications, meaning that the user can focus on deciding between a smaller number of products that match what they want. It is a powerful way to let users quickly sort through massive lists of products. In the example below, we are browsing monitors, and we have selected a price range, response time, and contrast ratio, which are represented both checks on the narrowing filter browser on the left, and as tags at the top of the page.<br>

The best parts about Search Narrowing is that it displays the number of items matching each filter so the user knows which filter criteria are the most common among manufacturers. Newegg refreshes the results every time a filter is added, creating annoying excess load times, but there are other versions of search narrowing that require the user to press submit before it applies the selected filters. Another possible issue with search narrowing is that if the user fills out the filters incorrectly, it could filter out results that may actually apply to them. Newegg’s Search Narrowing also hides filters that no longer apply to the current filtered list of products, so if the user is looking to add filters previously presented, they must go back to the page where all of the options for that filter were not already filtered out. In the example below, we selected a contrast ratio that only the manufacturer acer provides, so it hides the manufacturer filters on the left completely. <br>

Search narrowing is very applicable to roommate searching, as users could filter out people who do not meet their expectations. These expectations would be represented as filters such as noise, messiness, and bed time. Instead of doing a hard refresh of the page, we would design it such that it simply relists the results after clicking a filter, reducing the time it takes to search for roommates. Instead of hiding filters that no longer applied to the product listing, we could simply put a (0) next to the filter, designating that there are zero items that match the associated filter.
