			<h1>Needs Analysis</h1>
			<h2>Introduction:</h2> <p>In our HFID project, we are exploring how to design a service to improve the roommate searching process. We want to enable people to find the best roommates and housing for them, whether they have an empty room available or are looking for people to rent an apartment with. This section details the process and results of our exploratory phase, where we interviewed users, synthesized data from the interviews and our research, and came up with the main needs and requirements we need to fulfill for our users. </p>
			<br>
			<h2>Personas:</h2><p> To assist us in our design process we came up with 3 personas. They are listed below. These personas represent possible users and their needs, values, and background. These will help us come up with solutions to fit our persona's needs. </p>
			<br>
			<h4>Fun Fred</h4>
			<p>27 year old man</p>
			<p>Values: Fun, safety, trust</p>
			<p>Needs: Ease of use, timeliness</p>
			<p>Goals: To find a roommate who is reliable about payment without visiting a ton of websites</p>
			<p>Fred and his 3 roommates have an empty room in their Atlanta apartment that they need to fill. They want another guy who won&rsquo;t mind some loud, late nights. Fred is in charge of collecting rent from everyone, so he wants someone will pay on time and also clean up after themselves. The housemates like hanging out to play board games and watch sports, so they'd like someone who is interested in similar things. </p>
			<p>Fred isn't great at technology, so he'd like a service that is free and easy to use where he can find someone to fill their empty room. He has a smartphone that he can take pictures and videos of the house and room with. Finding a roommate that he has friends in common with is not all that important to him. </p>

			<h4>Cautious Caitlyn</h4>
			<p>21 year old college junior</p>
			<p>Values: Safety, personal space, hard work</p>
			<p>Needs: Verification of roommates, well designed interface, lots of photos or videos</p>
			<p>Goals: To find an apartment that meets her standards and gives her a sense of security</p>
			<p>Caitlyn is a junior at boston university looking for a place to live during her internship in San Francisco over the summer. She is worried about finding somewhere that is both safe and affordable. She'd like to live with other girls and have her own bedroom. Caitlyn also wants to live within walking distance of her work, so within 2 miles. Her roommates don't need to be her new best friends, but they should be friendly to her. </p>
			<p>Caitlyn is a graphic design major so appreciates good user interfaces. Finding roommates who have friends or contacts in common with her is very important to her.</p>

			<h4>Greenhorn Greg</h4>
			<p>20 year old college sophomore</p>
			<p>Values: Privacy, Compatibility, Mutual understanding of expectations</p>
			<p>Needs: Listings looking for one person, To connect with other people seeking rooming</p>
			<p>Goals: To find a place where he can get his own room for his next school semester</p>
			<p>Greg is a 20 year old college student in his spring semester of his sophomore year. He is sick of his life in the dorms and aspires to secure an off campus apartment for his next year of school. He does not know anybody who he would like to live with, and has never gone through the renting process before. Greg would like a professional looking renter who can offer him an apartment sublet near the school.</p>

			<h2>New Design Brief:</h2> <p>See <a href='./projectbrief.html'>'Project Brief'</a> tab</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Artifacts:</h2> <p>Below are some of the design artifacts we used when determining the needs and requirements of our users. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Task Matrix:</h3>
			<p> Our task matrix outlines the tasks that our different users currently go through when they are searching for roommates. This task matrix is a synthesis of the users habits that we observed from interviews which we can use as a learning through our project design.</p>

			<br>
			<h3>User Narratives</h3>
			<p>Our user narrative interaction map outlines how we envision our different users and personas interacting with our software. We considered several different routes and rearranging items in the interaction map before we came to our final layout, sketched up below. We can use this interaction map as a starting point for designing the interactions the users will have with our product.</p>
