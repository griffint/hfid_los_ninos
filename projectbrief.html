			<h1 class="title">Project Proposal</h1>
			<p><h3>The Problem:</h3> How would you go about finding your ideal roommate? If you don't already have a roommate pairing, then finding roommates can be time-consuming task and very difficult. Ideally, people would like to room with people that they are compatible with, such as friends, who are people that they know and can trust. Unfortunately, for those without the option of rooming with their friend, the most commonly used interface is to inquire with friends about rooming situations posting listings on Craigslist.</p>
			<p>In current systems, such as Craigslist, scammers are abound and don't match people well based on anything other than how much they want to pay. Craigslist provides an interface for finding room listings in neighborhoods, but falls short with providing renter and prospective renter information, personality types and ID verification. People generally feel insecure and uncomfortable with the process in finding a roommate using current systems. For instance, Craigslist has a reputation for scammers posting fake listings. Additionally, these types of systems don't match people well based on anything other than how much they want to pay. People don't just want a room, they also want roommates they like living with.</p>
			<p><h3>The Users:</h3> Our users are anyone seeking a roommate or room to live in. As a group, they have a wide range of backgrounds in age, cleanliness and cautiousness in terms of security. They have several needs in common in finding a roommate that is somewhat related to rooms themselves, such as affordability and location of the property as well as people to share it with. They also have values that is more directly related to human traits, such as feeling a sense of security, a clear dialogue between roommates and landlord and compatible personalities amongst roommates. </p>
			<p> There are three different prospective groups we are designing our interface for, comprising of a current renter seeking a roommate, a prospective renter looking for a housing group and a prospective renter looking for a room. There are other edge cases that we have considered but have left out, such as groups who are disinterested in who they room with and those who are risk-seekers. We want to target groups that would be best served with our interface since our focus is to improve comfort in finding roommates by improving compatibility and providing a sense of security.</p>
			<p> Our users are currently frustrated, afraid, and tired of current roommate finding solutions. They always have to be on the lookout for scammers online, and verifying the identity of potential roommates is almost impossible on websites like Craigslist. They are frustrated with outdated and unintuitive user interfaces that just try to find a room instead of finding people they will connect with. They are constantly being overwhelmed with the existing tools that do not serve their needs. They spend way too much time searching for rooms and not enough time connecting with potential roommates, so they are sick of the process overall. </p>
			<p><h3>Requirements:</h3> We have a main list of requirements to satisfy in order for our service to significantly improve the roommate hunting experience.</p>
			<p>Fun Frank Needs: Ease of use, Timeliness </p>
			<ol>
			  <li><p>Our service should be built for the lowest common denominator of tech users</p></li>
			  <li><p>Our service should let apartment owners and apartment searchers set expectations for the people they connect with</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Greenhorn Greg Needs: Listings looking for one person, ability to connect with other people seeking rooming</p>
			<ol start="3">
			  <li><p>The service must create opportunities for communication between users</p></li>
			  <li><p>The service must engage both users who are outgoing and users who are shy or scared to contact roommates</p></li>
			  <li><p>The service must provide opportunities for people who do not know other users</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Cautious Caitlyn Needs: Verification of roommates, photos and videos of the space</p>
			<ol start="6">
			  <li><p>The service needs to provide roommate opportunities that satisfy whatever needs the user has of other users</p></li>
			  <li><p>The service must provide abilities to share photos and videos of the user/apartment</p></li>
			  <li><p>The service must have some form of acceptable verification for users</p></li>
			</ol>

			<p><h3>Impact:</h3> A societal impact of a successful solution will be that people would become comfortable find roommates online. People can be comfortable using the option of finding roommates online, in coexistence with traditional methods, such as contacting alumni networks and mutual friends. It would build the reputation and user's experience in finding roommates online as a result of improved roommate compatibility matching and an added sense of security.</p>
			<p> More specifically, for our targeted users groups:</p>
			<p>Renter seeking a roommate:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li><p>able to identify and contact candidates easily without any technical knowledge</p></li>
			  <li><p>reliably and effectively communicate with roommate to set expectations </p></li>

			  <li><p>gives the user opportunities to meet people he is compatable with whom he did not previously know</p></li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="subtitle">The Problem</h3>
			<p>
			It is currently very difficult to find roommates in a safe, reliable, and easy way. Current interfaces such as browsing Craigslist are not intuitive, not people oriented, and kind of scary. People get scammed out of money fairly often searching for a room. Users don't just want a room, they want roommates who they will enjoy living with. </p>
			<h3 class="subtitle">Changing Status Quo</h3>
			<p>
			Currently, the main methods of finding roommates are through Facebook groups, Craigslist or word of mouth. This project will enable these types of users to find roommates that are better matched to their personality and lifestyle with a sense of security. Various verification methods will help users feel they are talking to real people and not scam artists. Also, current systems are mainly focused around finding a certain room or type of house with not much emphasis on the roommates themselves, which can lead to very bad pairings.</p>
			<h3 class="subtitle">Design Idea</h3>
			<p>This sketch addresses the issue of not matching people well as roommates. Drawn below is Jim's profile based on information Jim provided. In addition to his own interests, Jim has also filled out information on the desired qualities of somebody he is interested in matching with. The system goes through and finds profiles of users based on the qualities Jim is looking for and presents other people's profiles like his own. The profile will also include mutual Facebook friends as a form of verification and potential source of common interests. </p>

			<h3 class="subtitle">Users and Information</h3>
			<p>Finding users should be fairly easy in the Boston area. There are many at Babson and Olin who have gone through the experience of roommate hunting. At first we will need to collect information about the pain points of roommate hunting. We plan on asking them questions such as their background and experiences in finding potential roommates. </p>
			<h3 class="subtitle">Learning Goals</h3> 
			<p> Improve our skills of interviewing users and synthesizing information. Get better at the process of interface design. Improve technical proficiency in interface design and production through use of technologies like Javascript and CSS. 
			Logistics and team organization: We plan on keeping a physical scrum board in the classroom. We will stay in contact through email and Facebook chat and will keep common files in a Google drive folder.
