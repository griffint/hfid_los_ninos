			<h1 class="title">Project Proposal</h1>
			<h3 class="subtitle">The Problem</h3>
			<p>
			It is currently very difficult to find roommates in a safe, reliable, and easy way. Current interfaces such as browsing Craigslist are not intuitive, not people oriented, and kind of scary. People get scammed out of money fairly often searching for a room. Users don’t just want a room, they want roommates who they will enjoy living with. </p>
			<h3 class="subtitle">Changing Status Quo</h3>
			<p>
			Currently, the main methods of finding roommates are through Facebook groups, Craigslist or word of mouth. This project will enable these types of users to find roommates that are better matched to their personality and lifestyle with a sense of security. Various verification methods will help users feel they are talking to real people and not scam artists. Also, current systems are mainly focused around finding a certain room or type of house with not much emphasis on the roommates themselves, which can lead to very bad pairings.</p>
			<h3 class="subtitle">Design Idea</h3>
			<p>This sketch addresses the issue of not matching people well as roommates. Drawn below is Jim’s profile based on information Jim provided. In addition to his own interests, Jim has also filled out information on the desired qualities of somebody he is interested in matching with. The system goes through and finds profiles of users based on the qualities Jim is looking for and presents other people’s profiles like his own. The profile will also include mutual Facebook friends as a form of verification and potential source of common interests. </p>

			<h3 class="subtitle">Users and Information</h3>
			<p>Finding users should be fairly easy in the Boston area. There are many at Babson and Olin who have gone through the experience of roommate hunting. At first we will need to collect information about the pain points of roommate hunting. We plan on asking them questions such as their background and experiences in finding potential roommates. </p>
			<h3 class="subtitle">Learning Goals</h3> 
			<p> Improve our skills of interviewing users and synthesizing information. Get better at the process of interface design. Improve technical proficiency in interface design and production through use of technologies like Javascript and CSS. 
			Logistics and team organization: We plan on keeping a physical scrum board in the classroom. We will stay in contact through email and Facebook chat and will keep common files in a Google drive folder.
